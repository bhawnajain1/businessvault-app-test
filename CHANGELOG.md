# Changelog

All notable changes to BusinessVault are recorded here. This file is kept in
sync with `package.json` on every PR — see feedback_1_to_7.md §19 and the
per-PR-version-bump policy.

## 1.0.9 — 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- **Sales Return inventory valuation.** Inventory-tracked returns now restore stock at the original invoice sale movement's cost instead of the sale price or current moving average. Existing moving-average stock value remains unchanged, matching the established quantity-only return behavior. If the historical cost ledger is incomplete, posting stops rather than inventing a valuation.
- **Sales Return COGS reversal.** Return journals now post a balanced debit to Inventory and credit to Cost of Goods Sold for the restored historical cost. Cancelling a return reverses those exact journal lines and stock movements, including when the item's current inventory-tracking setting changed after the sale.

### Diagnostics

- Added the aggregate COGS reversal amount to the structured Sales Return completion log.

### Tests

- Added regressions for historical-cost stock movements, cumulative split-return rounding, Inventory/COGS journal lines, incomplete-cost-ledger rejection, changed inventory-tracking settings, and exact cancellation reversal.

## 1.0.8 — 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- **Complete restore settlement rebuild.** Restore now derives supplier bill `paid_paise`, `balance_paise`, and status from payment allocations and supplier advance applications, matching the existing invoice rebuild.
- **Sales Return balance recovery.** Active Sales Returns are included when rebuilding invoice balances, while cancelled or deleted returns are excluded. Legacy returns without the persisted settlement split use their total less customer credit.
- **Deterministic inventory valuation.** Restore now replays stock movements in their persisted insertion order using the application's moving-average inbound-cost rule instead of treating the last non-zero movement cost as the average. Existing cache rows with no backing movements are removed.

### Diagnostics

- Added structured, metadata-only summaries for rebuilt inventory rows and document settlement targets.

### Tests

- Added restore coverage for supplier payments and advance applications, Sales Return balance reductions, moving-average inventory cost, and stale stock-cache removal.

## 1.0.7 — 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- **Complete restore event replay.** Added replay support for Sales Return headers/items and cancellations, purchase reversals, and category, unit, warehouse, account, and other entity updates that were previously skipped.
- **Non-destructive update replay.** Partial journal payloads now merge into existing rows instead of replacing complete invoices, customers, suppliers, items, payments, advances, expenses, and master data with fragments.
- **Recycle Bin accounting replay.** Invoice deletion replay now preserves `deletion_reversal_journal_id`, allowing a restored recycled invoice to unreverse its accounting correctly.

### Diagnostics

- Added structured warnings for unhandled events and missing update/reversal targets, plus debug records describing merged fields and entity-version transitions and an info record for each applied purchase reversal.

### Tests

- Added restore regression coverage for partial-update preservation, Sales Return create/cancel replay, Sales Return item replay, purchase reversal replay, and deletion-reversal pointer preservation.

## 1.0.6 — 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- **Business-scoped backup and restore.** Snapshots now export only the selected business profile instead of leaking every local business into `businesses.csv`. Restoring a business replaces only that business's rows and sync events, preserving every other local business and its unshipped work.

### Diagnostics

- Added structured restore lifecycle logs for provider connection, business discovery and selection, integrity and unshipped-work preflight, snapshot and journal loading, per-table replacement counts, replay failures and totals, derived-cache rebuilds, validation results, and final duration/counts.
- Added per-table snapshot serialization logs with row count, byte count, and duration to make large or stalled backups diagnosable from exported debug logs.

### Tests

- Added multi-business regression coverage proving one business cannot enter another business's snapshot and restoring one business preserves another business's profile, records, and unshipped sync event.

## 1.0.5 — 2026-09-07

### Added

- **Permanent invoice deletion from the Recycle Bin.** A new **Delete permanently** action removes a recycled invoice header, its lines, and derived return-summary rows after explicit confirmation. Accounting journals and sync history remain append-only so financial reports and the audit trail are preserved. Invoices referenced by another invoice or a Sales Return remain protected.
- **Safe settlement cascade.** Hidden payments allocated only to the deleted invoice and hidden, fully applied advances linked only to it are removed with the invoice. Shared or active payments, shared advances, and advances with unapplied credit block deletion to prevent dangling references or lost customer credit.
- **Backup/restore replay support.** Permanent-deletion events carry the exact cascaded payment and advance IDs. Replay validates business ownership, cascade tags, exclusive references, and remaining advance credit before removing settlement rows.

### Tests

- Added InvoiceService coverage for permanent deletion, accounting-history preservation, related-document guards, exclusive payment cascade, shared-payment protection, and unapplied-advance protection.
- Added restore coverage for idempotent permanent-deletion replay and protection of active or changed settlement records.

## 1.0.4 — 2026-08-27

### Added

- **Preemptive version-preflight reloader** — [`src/lib/versionPreflight.ts`](https://github.com/bhawnajain1/BusinessVault/blob/main/src/lib/versionPreflight.ts). Complements the reactive `lazyWithReload` guard shipped in [1.0.3](https://github.com/bhawnajain1/BusinessVault/commit/c6f122c1fd3c3545bb73c5e54de8af9967a97625). On app boot, extracts the hashed entry-bundle path (`assets/index-<hash>.js`) from the live document as a version fingerprint. Re-fetches `index.html` with `cache: 'no-store'` on `visibilitychange → visible`, on `online`, and every 5 minutes while the tab is visible; if the deployed entry-hash no longer matches the boot hash, does one `window.location.reload()`. Result: a tab held open across a deploy self-heals when the user returns to it, BEFORE they click a link that would trigger a 404-ing dynamic import.
  - **Evidence this is needed**: the 2026-08-27 07:38:51Z debug bundle showed a `Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: .../Invoices-CqHElkv4.js` error from a tab that booted at 07:07:01Z — 10 minutes before the 1.0.3 fix deployed at 07:17:43Z. The reactive guard couldn't help because the code that installs it wasn't in the browser yet. Preflight closes that window: after 1.0.4 propagates, the *next* deploy's stale tab reloads on tab-focus instead of on click.
  - **Session-scoped guard** via `sessionStorage['bv:preflight-reloaded-to']` records the target hash — if a CDN inconsistency briefly serves an older `index.html` after the reload, we don't bounce.
  - **Interactive-route protection**: skips the auto-reload on `/pos`, `/invoices/new`, `/invoices/:id/edit`, `/purchases/new`, `/onboarding` — these hold in-memory line-item state that hasn't been committed. On those routes, the preflight logs `deferring — unsafe path` and waits; the next check on a safe route reloads.
  - **Silent on network failure**: no `alert()`, no visible error, just a `log.info` — the user's offline state is indistinguishable from Pages being briefly unavailable, and either way no reload should fire.

### Tests

- **19 unit tests** in [`src/lib/versionPreflight.test.ts`](https://github.com/bhawnajain1/BusinessVault/blob/main/src/lib/versionPreflight.test.ts) — 6 for the `extractEntryHash` HTML parser (Vite shape, single-quoted attrs, extra attrs, no-match, non-Vite scripts, non-module scripts) and 13 for the check flow (matching-hash no-op, mismatch reloads once, second-reload guard, unsafe path (`/pos`), unsafe path (`/invoices/:id/edit`), hidden-tab skip, network failure silence, missing-script silence, non-2xx silence, cache/cachebuster shape, idempotent install, no-op without entry script).

## 1.0.3 — 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- **Black page after deploy: lazy-route imports now self-heal from a stale chunk map.** Every route in `App.tsx` is a `React.lazy()` import whose chunk filenames carry a Vite content hash (e.g. `InvoiceForm-CHaK4dxT.js`). A tab held open across a Pages deploy still holds the *old* filename map, so navigating to a not-yet-visited route triggers `import()` → 404 on the old filename → the promise rejects → React unmounts the whole Suspense subtree → the user sees a black page until they refresh. Evidence: the 2026-08-27 07:05:34Z debug bundle captured the exact shape: `Uncaught TypeError: Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: https://bhawnajain1.github.io/businessvault-app/assets/InvoiceForm-CHaK4dxT.js`. Fix: added `src/lib/lazyWithReload.ts` — a drop-in `React.lazy()` replacement that catches the `Failed to fetch dynamically imported module` / `ChunkLoadError` shape and does one `window.location.reload()` (which fetches the current `index.html` and its fresh chunk map). Guarded via `sessionStorage['bv:chunk-reload-attempted']` so a genuine build corruption can't loop forever — after one attempt within the session, the error surfaces to the ErrorBoundary. All ~39 lazy imports in `App.tsx` swapped to `lazyWithReload(..., 'RouteLabel')`, the label lands in the debug log alongside the failure. See `src/lib/lazyWithReload.ts` for full rationale.

### Added

- **Top-level `ErrorBoundary` around the routed tree** so a render-time throw (or a chunk-load error that couldn't self-heal) shows a friendly "Something went wrong" panel with a Reload button and a Copy-error-details button, instead of a black page. Stack + component stack + `isChunkLoad` classification are written to the debug log so a support export contains everything needed to diagnose. Chunk-specific fallback message is briefer ("The app was updated — reload to continue"). Source: [`src/ui/ErrorBoundary.tsx`](https://github.com/bhawnajain1/BusinessVault/blob/main/src/ui/ErrorBoundary.tsx).
- **Regression tests** for the chunk-load recovery logic: 12 unit tests in [`src/lib/lazyWithReload.test.ts`](https://github.com/bhawnajain1/BusinessVault/blob/main/src/lib/lazyWithReload.test.ts) cover the browser-shape matcher (Vite, Webpack ChunkLoadError, Firefox variant, plain string, non-chunk errors, null/undefined) and the four decision paths of `loadWithChunkRecovery` (success, non-chunk-error passthrough, fresh chunk → set flag + reload, chunk-with-prior-reload → give up + throw).

## 1.0.2 — 2026-08-27

### Added

- **Regression tests** pinning the dashboard/invoices-page/receivables-report coherence invariant. Extracted the dashboard KPI computation out of `Dashboard.tsx` into a pure `computeDashboardStats` function in `src/domain/dashboardStats.ts`, so it can be unit-tested without React. Added [`src/domain/dashboardStats.test.ts`](https://github.com/bhawnajain1/BusinessVault/blob/main/src/domain/dashboardStats.test.ts) with 13 tests that hand-craft the rename-edit trio (original + credit note + reissue) and pin `dashboard.invoices == invoices-page filter count` and `dashboard.outstandingReceivablesPaise == computeReceivables(...).totals.outstanding_paise`. Added [`tests/dashboard-coherence.spec.ts`](https://github.com/bhawnajain1/BusinessVault/blob/main/tests/dashboard-coherence.spec.ts) with 3 integration tests that run the real `InvoiceService.createInvoice` + `updateInvoice` code paths against fake-indexeddb — reproducing the exact debug-log scenario the user reported (4 creates → 2 renames → 1 more) and asserting all three surfaces agree on the count and totals. If a future change makes any surface diverge, one of these tests fails.
- **Debug diagnostics on the dashboard.** The `dashboard.stats computed` log line now includes `supersededInvoices`, `creditNotes`, `recycledInvoices`, `supersededPurchases`, and `debitNotes` counts alongside the live totals — so a future "count looks off" report can be diagnosed straight from the JSONL bundle without re-running the app. Added a `log.warn('dashboard', 'unusually large hidden-invoice gap', …)` guard that fires when the raw-vs-live gap exceeds 5× the live count (empirical threshold — see `Dashboard.tsx` for rationale).

## 1.0.1 — 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- **Dashboard: invoice count and outstanding totals were double-counting rename-edits.** When an invoice is edited with a new invoice number (§3), `InvoiceService.updateInvoice` performs a reverse + reissue: the original stays in `db.invoices` with `reversed_by_invoice_id` set, a credit note (`reverses_invoice_id`) is appended, and a fresh reissue is added — three rows per rename. The dashboard was calling `db.invoices.toArray()` and summing raw `balance_paise` across every row, so a rename made the count jump by +2 and the outstanding-receivables number drift upward. The Invoices page (`InvoicesPage.tsx`) already filtered out both `reversed_by_invoice_id` and `reverses_invoice_id` when `showVoided=false`, which is why the invoice list showed the correct 3 rows while the dashboard showed more. Fix: `Dashboard.tsx` now (1) filters to the same "live invoice" set for its count and Recent Invoices table, and (2) derives outstanding receivables/payables via `computeReceivables` / `computePayables` from `partyLedger.ts` — the same functions the Receivables/Payables report uses. Symmetric fix applied for purchases (`reversed_by_purchase_id` / `reverses_purchase_id`).
- Added structured `log.info('dashboard', 'stats computed', {...})` per the log-liberally policy so debug bundles capture the raw-vs-live counts and derived totals for future drift diagnosis.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-08-26

### Release: feedback_1_to_7.md series complete

The 28-section consolidated feedback landed across PRs [#40](https://github.com/bhawnajain1/BusinessVault/pull/40)–[#50](https://github.com/bhawnajain1/BusinessVault/pull/50) over ten shippable phases. This 1.0.0 release cuts the line: every feedback item that had a defined acceptance criterion is now implemented, tested against the §24 regression assertions, and gated by `npm run release:gate` (§26).

**§28 Final Report**

- Previous application version: `0.20.0`
- New application version: `1.0.0`
- Dexie schema version: `8` (last bumped in §2 Signature — no schema changes needed for this release)
- Backup format version: `1` (added in §20)

**Features implemented (Feedback #1–#7 + platform mandates §8–§26)**

| Section | Feature | Ships in |
|---|---|---|

| §13,§14,§15,§16 | Correlation IDs + Diagnostic Bundle (structured logs, redaction, downloadable JSON) | `0.18.0` |
| §17 | Reconciliation After High-Risk Operations (`reconcileAfter` wired into all edit/recycle/restore paths) | `0.19.0` |
| §19 | Application Version Bump (single source `package.json.version` → Vite `__APP_VERSION__` → Header + Diagnostic + Drive manifest) | Per-PR |
| §20 | Google Drive Backup / Restore (sales_returns, sales_return_items, attachments, audit_log now snapshotted) | `0.19.0` |
| §21,§22,§24 | Test suite + Cross-feature integration + Regression assertions | `0.20.0` |
| §26 | Release Gate (`scripts/release-gate.mjs` — typecheck + lint + unit + integration + build) | `0.20.0` |

**Tests (results from `npm run release:gate`)**

- Typecheck: PASS
- Lint: PASS
- Unit tests: PASS (all `src/**` .test.ts pass)
- Integration tests: PASS (all `tests/**` .spec.ts pass — including the Sharma Electronics disaster-recovery E2E)
- Regression assertions: PASS (21 unit cases in `src/testing/regressionAssertions.test.ts`)
- Migration tests: PASS (v6/v7/v8 migrations covered in the existing schema migration test suite)
- Drive backup/restore: PASS (`tests/e2e/google-drive-disaster-recovery.spec.ts` reconstructs bit-exactly from Drive alone)
- Production build: PASS (`vite build` succeeds)

**Also fixed in this release**

- **Stale post-GIS OAuth test.** `tests/e2e/interruption.spec.ts` scenario 5 was asserting pre-GIS behaviour (worker auto-reconnects on `OAUTH_EXPIRED`). Post-GIS the worker never auto-reconnects (no client secret, user gesture required) — the test now asserts the current contract: a `DriveNeedsReconnect` error surfaces via `onStateChange` as DISCONNECTED/ERROR so Settings can render the banner, and local Dexie writes keep working.

**Known limitations**

- `dist/assets/TrialBalancePage-*.js` weighs in at 954 kB minified (274 kB gzip). Warned but not blocked by Vite. Fixing needs `manualChunks` in `vite.config.ts`; deferred as it's a size-optimisation, not a correctness issue.
- `payment.edit` / `payment.recycle` / `payment.restore` op strings are accepted by `reconcileAfter` but not currently wired — those code paths don't exist yet in `PaymentService`. The op strings are reserved so future work can wire them without a signature change.

## 0.20.0 — 2026-08-26

### §22 §24 §26 — Reusable regression assertions, cross-feature integration, release gate

- **§24 Regression assertion library.** New
  `src/testing/regressionAssertions.ts` exposes eight named invariants —
  `assertAccountingBalanced`, `assertInvoiceDueNonNegative`,
  `assertPaymentAllocationsBounded`, `assertSalesReturnQtyBounded`,
  `assertInventoryIdentity`, `assertReceivablesConsistent`,
  `assertPayablesConsistent`, `assertRoundOffIdentity`,
  `assertNoDuplicateInvoiceNumbers` — plus `runFullRegressionSuite` which
  aggregates every assertion for a business into one pass/fail result. Every
  helper throws a typed `RegressionAssertionError` carrying the failing check
  slug and the numeric evidence, so a failure lands with actionable info,
  not just a boolean. Unit-tested in
  `src/testing/regressionAssertions.test.ts` (21 cases: each helper's happy
  path + at least one violation path, plus the aggregator).
- **§22 Cross-feature integration tests.** New
  `tests/cross-feature-integration.spec.ts` exercises real service call
  chains (no mocks) with `runFullRegressionSuite` after every step:
  - Round Off + Recycle + Restore — rounded invoice stays balanced through
    two full delete → restore cycles (catches mirror-journal drift on the
    round-off account specifically).
  - Round Off + Payment — paying a rounded invoice in full settles it to
    exactly zero balance with no fractional drift across A/R.
- **Fix (uncovered by §24).** `InvoiceService.createInvoice` was writing
  `journal_entries.total_debit_paise` / `total_credit_paise` as the invoice's
  `totalPaise`, ignoring the round-off Dr line that
  `buildInvoiceJournalLines` appended when the pre-round sum exceeded the
  rounded total. Per-line dr/cr sums balanced (17 paise on both sides), but
  the stored header was off by the same 17 paise. `accountingSelfCheck` and
  therefore §17 `reconcileAfter` would have tripped on any rounded invoice —
  no shipped tests exercised that combination. Fix: recompute the header
  totals from the actual `linesToPost` right before the write, so the header
  is guaranteed consistent with its lines.
- **§26 Release gate.** New `scripts/release-gate.mjs` runs the five
  mandatory pre-release checks in sequence — typecheck, lint, unit tests,
  integration tests, production build — and prints a per-check pass/fail
  table with per-check wall time. Non-zero exit iff any check failed.
  Wired into `npm run release:gate`.

## 0.19.0 — 2026-08-26

### Drive backup coverage + post-op reconciliation (feedback_1_to_7.md §17, §20)

- **§20 Drive backup — four missing tables now snapshotted.**
  `src/restore/tableSchema.ts` grows specs for `sales_returns`,
  `sales_return_items`, `attachments`, and `audit_log`. The Snapshot
  Now button and the (unwired) scheduler both pick these up
  automatically since `buildSnapshotInput` iterates `TABLE_SPECS`.
  Restore already loops the same specs — a Drive restore now
  reconstructs Sales Returns, attachment metadata, and the audit
  trail bit-exactly from CSV. Attachment BLOB bytes continue to ship
  out-of-band via `attachment_upload` sync jobs and are referenced
  from the row's `drive_file_id`; the CSV row itself is scrubbed of
  the raw `blob` field so it can never sneak into the CSV.
- **§20 manifest fields.** The snapshot manifest now emits
  `applicationVersion` (from Vite's `__APP_VERSION__` define,
  `'0.0.0'` fallback under Node test) and `backupFormatVersion`
  (new constant `BACKUP_FORMAT_VERSION = 1`) alongside the existing
  `schemaVersion`. Older snapshots without these fields still restore
  cleanly — the reader treats missing values as unknown.
- **§20 audit_log JSON round-trip.** `audit_log.before` and
  `audit_log.after` are pre-JSON.stringified at snapshot write time
  and coerced back through `tableSchema.coerceRow`'s `'json'` branch
  on read, so the columns round-trip through CSV without turning into
  `[object Object]`.
- **§17 reconciliation helper.** New `src/domain/reconciliation.ts`
  exposes `reconcileAfter(businessId, op, opts)` — runs
  `accountingSelfCheck` + a receivables consistency check, and on
  failure both writes a durable `reconciliation.failed` row to
  `audit_log` and emits a structured `log.warn`. Never throws —
  callers are on their happy path and a post-hoc invariant tripping
  must not roll back the domain op; the audit_log + debug bundle
  entries are how failures surface to support.
- **§17 wiring.** Reconciliation now runs after every high-risk op
  that has an implemented code path:
  - `InvoiceService.deleteInvoice` (invoice recycle)
  - `InvoiceService.restoreInvoice` (invoice restore)
  - `InvoiceService.updateInvoice` (invoice edit — reverse + reissue)
  - `SalesReturnService.createSalesReturn` (sales_return.create)
  - `SalesReturnService.cancelSalesReturn` (sales_return.cancel)
  - `PurchaseService.update` (purchase reverse + reissue)
  - `PaymentService.refundPayment` (payment.refund)
  - `rebuildFromDrive` was already wired (kept for parity).
  Payment edit / recycle / restore have no implementation to wire —
  the reconcileAfter helper accepts those op strings for when those
  paths land.
- **Tests.** `src/domain/reconciliation.test.ts` (4 cases: balanced
  journal → ok, unbalanced journal → failure + audit_log row, empty
  journal → ok, log breadcrumbs land). `src/sync/buildSnapshotInput.test.ts`
  gains 2 cases: manifest carries applicationVersion + schemaVersion +
  backupFormatVersion, and the four new CSVs are emitted with
  audit_log JSON preserved (never `[object Object]`).

## 0.18.0 — 2026-08-26

### Correlation IDs + Diagnostic Report bundle (feedback_1_to_7.md §13, §14, §15, §16)

- **§14 correlation IDs.** New `src/lib/operationId.ts` exposes
  `newOperationId()` (26-char Crockford-base32 ULID; time-sortable prefix)
  and `withOperation(event, opts, body)` — a thin wrapper that generates
  or reuses an `operationId`, logs `<event>.start` / `<event>.success` /
  `<event>.failure` bracketing the body, and rethrows on error. Any
  nested `log.info` inside the body that threads through the same
  `operationId` links to the outer operation in the diagnostic bundle.
  Callers pass `{ operationId }` down through service boundaries so a
  single Recycle / Restore / Backup / Restore-from-Drive traces to one
  contiguous log run.
- **§16 diagnostic bundle.** Settings → Support / Diagnostics now shows
  an **Export Diagnostic Report** button. Clicking it produces a
  timestamped `businessvault-diagnostic-<iso>.json` download containing:
  - App version + build mode (production / development)
  - Dexie schema version + business `schema_version`
  - Browser / platform / language user-agent context
  - Business metadata (id, name, state_code, drive_connected — never
    signature blob or OAuth tokens)
  - Trial-Balance reconciliation snapshot (debits/credits paise +
    balanced boolean) and receivables total
  - Last 100 `audit_log` rows for the current business, reverse-chrono
  - Last 24 h of `debug_logs`, plus grepped `drive.backup` and
    `drive.restore` sub-buckets so a Drive-flow report lands with just
    the relevant events at the top
- **§15 redaction.** The bundle re-uses the existing `log.ts`
  `SENSITIVE_KEY_RE` / `STACK_TOKEN_RE` / `LONG_TOKEN_RE` redaction —
  every entry it emits has already been scrubbed of `access_token`,
  `refresh_token`, `password`, `secret`, `api_key`, and any raw
  base64/hex tokens > 24 chars. A regression test asserts that a fake
  OAuth exchange log never surfaces in the exported JSON.
- **§13 log discipline.** All new code paths use `log.info` at entry /
  branch / exit with a stable `source` string so a support ticket can
  be triaged from the exported bundle alone, without asking the user to
  reproduce.
- **Tests.** `src/lib/operationId.test.ts` (5 cases: fresh ULID,
  monotonic time prefix, id generation, id reuse, start/success/failure
  logging, nested link) and `src/lib/diagnosticBundle.test.ts` (6 cases:
  empty state, business present, Drive-linked shape, audit reverse-chrono,
  backup/restore bucketing, sensitive-key redaction).

## 0.17.1 — 2026-08-26

### Fix: Data & Backup "DISCONNECTED" banner stuck after successful reconnect

- **Bug.** After completing Google Drive Reconnect from Settings → Data &
  Backup, the yellow "Google Drive backup disconnected" banner and the
  `DISCONNECTED` status pill remained on-screen even though Drive was
  actually connected and events were syncing (Last event sync updated,
  Pending = 0). Root cause: `BackupSettings.tsx` read
  `provider.connectionStatus()` **once at mount time**. The reconnect flow
  triggers a page reload, and on the first render immediately after the
  reload the sync-worker registry could still be empty for a brief moment.
  The `conn` state captured `DISCONNECTED` and never re-read — even after
  the worker registered its restored provider a second later.
- **Fix.** `BackupSettings.tsx` now polls `getActiveProvider().connectionStatus()`
  every 2 s (mirroring the `useBackupHealth` polling pattern already used
  for the sync-worker health value on the same screen). The status pill and
  banner now reflect current reality within one poll cycle of any change.
- **Testing.** New `src/ui/settings/BackupSettings.test.ts` pins down the
  `deriveDisplayStatus(conn, healthStatus, integrity)` precedence contract
  (extracted as a pure exported helper so future refactors can't reintroduce
  the stale-input regression). Includes an explicit "CONNECTED + HEALTHY
  must NOT display DISCONNECTED" assertion that replays the 2026-08-26 bug.
- **Debug logs.** Added structured `log.info` on every provider
  connection-state transition and every displayed-status transition, so
  future reports of this shape land with a clear trail in the exported
  debug bundle.

## 0.17.0 — 2026-08-26

### GSTIN → State auto-detection (feedback_1_to_7.md §12)

- **Auto-fill state from GSTIN in every party form.** Business onboarding
  (Step 2), Settings → Business Profile, Customers, and Suppliers now
  derive State/UT from the GSTIN's first two characters as the user types.
  Empty state field + valid 2-digit prefix → state auto-fills; keystroke
  changes to the prefix follow along.
- **Manual override wins.** Once the user picks a state from the dropdown,
  subsequent GSTIN edits do NOT overwrite that choice — instead an inline
  `⚠ GSTIN begins with 08 (Rajasthan), but selected State is Maharashtra
  (27). Please verify.` warning appears next to the field. Clearing either
  the GSTIN or the state re-enables auto-detect (that's how the user tells
  the form to resume auto-fill).
- **Detected badge.** A `✓ Detected from GSTIN: Rajasthan (08)` confirmation
  renders whenever the derived and selected state agree, so the shopkeeper
  can see the tax logic downstream will read the right code.
- **Centralised state-code map.** All four form surfaces plus the badge
  component now share the same helpers in `src/lib/gstinStateSync.ts` and
  `src/ui/components/GstinStateBadge.tsx`, and the duplicate map that
  lived in `ui/onboarding/state.ts` re-exports the canonical one from
  `src/lib/indianStates.ts` — one authority for the 40 codes.
- **Tests.** `src/lib/gstinStateSync.test.ts` covers 16 cases: prefix
  auto-fill, follow-along on prefix change, manual-override latch,
  clear-to-reset-latch, incomplete-prefix passthrough, mismatch detection,
  and legacy-record inference at load time.

## 0.16.0 — 2026-08-26

### Low-stock / reorder alerts (feedback_1_to_7.md §8)

- **Threshold-crossing detection.** Any stock movement — invoice line
  posted, sale-return restore, purchase received, adjustment — that pulls
  an item's cross-warehouse total from above its `reorder_level_micros` to
  at-or-below it fires a `bv:low-stock` window event. Follow-up decrements
  while still under the threshold do NOT re-fire; only the crossing itself
  does. Going back above the threshold fires a `cleared` event.
- **Zero touch on stock-writing services.** The detector rides on
  `item_stock` Dexie hooks in `src/db/database.ts` — every service that
  writes to `item_stock` (InventoryService, InvoiceService, PurchaseService,
  SalesReturnService, ReturnService, rebuildFromDrive) gets crossing
  detection for free, without any coupling to alert logic.
- **Notification centre.** New bell icon in the app header with an unread
  badge and a dropdown of recent alerts. Ephemeral (in-memory, per-tab) —
  the durable "what is currently low" view lives in Reports > Stock
  Valuation, which is the right place for that concern.
- **Toast + attention sound.** A crossing pops a bottom-right toast that
  auto-dismisses in 6 s and offers "View Item" / "Dismiss". A short two-
  tone WebAudio beep plays alongside — no asset bundled. Browser autoplay
  restrictions are handled gracefully: when the AudioContext is suspended
  the beep is skipped (logged, not thrown), and Settings > Test Sound
  gives the user a way to unlock alerts during a genuine click gesture.
- **Skip rules.** Services (`is_service=1`), items with
  `track_inventory=0`, and items with `reorder_level_micros=0` (unset
  threshold) never generate alerts.
- **Settings > Notifications.** Three device-local controls, backed by
  localStorage (no schema bump — this is UX state, not business data):
  Low Stock Alerts toggle, Notification Sound toggle, Test Sound button.
  Defaults ON per spec.
- **Tests.** `src/domain/lowStockAlerts.test.ts` covers 12 cases:
  crossing, non-re-fire while low, clear-when-recovered, out-of-stock
  branding, service skip, non-tracked skip, unset-threshold skip,
  cross-warehouse aggregation, missing-item safety, and snapshot loader.

### Sales Return audit + gap-fill (feedback_1_to_7.md §5, §6, §7)

- **§5.3 — Sales Return picker shows original economics.** The per-line
  picker in `SalesReturnPicker.tsx` now surfaces the columns a shopkeeper
  needs to decide what they're refunding: **Unit** (looked up from the
  item's `unit_id`), **Orig. rate** (`line.unit_price_paise`), **Discount**
  (`line.discount_paise`), and **GST %** (`line.tax_rate_bps / 100`) — all
  read from the invoice line itself, never the current item-master, so
  edits to a product's price after the sale don't rewrite the return
  screen.
- **§7.4 — Snapshot restore rebuilds the return summary cache.**
  `rebuildFromDrive` now runs `rebuildInvoiceLineReturnSummary` after the
  inventory identity check and before the GST reconciliation pass. This
  closes a gap where a restore from an older snapshot (or event-only
  replay) would leave `invoice_line_return_summary` empty even though the
  authoritative `sales_return_items` rows were fully restored — the first
  render of the return picker post-restore now shows correct
  "Prev. returned" / "Available" values without waiting for the next
  create-return round-trip to backfill the cache.

All other §5, §6, §7 items (per-line qty capping, journal reversal,
inventory reversal, guard against editing an invoice with active returns,
customer credit issuance, hash-chain preservation across returns) were
already implemented in prior PRs — this release fills only the two audit
gaps.

## 0.14.0 — 2026-08-26

### Authorised Signature on invoices (feedback_1_to_7.md §2)

- **Settings → Business Profile** gains an *Authorised Signature* block:
  upload / preview / replace / remove, plus a *Show signature on new invoices*
  toggle. Uploads accept PNG, JPG, or WebP up to 2 MB and 2000×2000 px; the
  service (`src/domain/BusinessProfileService.ts`) validates MIME, size, and
  pixel dimensions and rejects with a `SignatureValidationError`.
- Signature images are stored as attachments with `ref_type='signature'`,
  `ref_id=<business_id>`. Every upload creates a **fresh** attachment row so
  historical invoices resolve to the signature that was current the day they
  were issued — replacing the signature never rewrites history.
- New invoices snapshot the current signature onto
  `invoice.signature_attachment_id` at creation time (only when the toggle is
  on). The invoice print surface (`InvoicePrint.tsx`) now renders the pinned
  attachment blob instead of the current business signature — so reprinting
  an old invoice still shows the exact image that appeared on the original.
- Schema is bumped to v8. Existing rows are backfilled (`signature_ref=null`,
  `show_signature_on_invoice=0`, `signature_attachment_id=null`) both at
  Dexie open time and at snapshot-restore time.
- New tests: `src/domain/BusinessProfileService.test.ts` covers validation,
  attachment write on first upload, fresh-row-on-replace (no mutation of the
  old row), signature-off toggling, and the historical-preservation
  invariant (INV-001 keeps V1, INV-002 pins V2, toggle-off yields null).

### Editable invoice number + recycled-number reuse (feedback_1_to_7.md §3, §4)

- **§3** The Edit Invoice screen now allows changing the Invoice #. Uniqueness
  is validated within the business + prefix series; a rename writes an
  `invoice.number_changed` row to `audit_log` (with before/after) so the
  history is preserved. Renaming does NOT create a Sales Return — the edit
  path continues to reissue via the append-only reversal + fresh-invoice
  shape, just under the new number.
- **§4** A recycled invoice's number is released back into the pool.
  `allocateInvoiceNumber` now scans for the lowest recycled gap below
  `invoice_next_seq` and reuses it before incrementing the counter. The
  `createInvoice` uniqueness guard was widened to ignore rows with
  `deleted_at != null` in addition to already-superseded rows.
- New centralised helpers in `src/domain/invoiceNumbering.ts`:
  - `getNextAvailableInvoiceNumber(db, businessId)` — read-only preview of
    the next auto-allocation candidate.
  - `isInvoiceNumberAvailable(db, businessId, number, excludeInvoiceId?)` —
    true iff no LIVE invoice uses the number.
  - `validateInvoiceNumber(number, expectedPrefix?)` — format check
    (`PREFIX-<digits>`) with optional series match.
- Restore-conflict handling: `restoreInvoice` now throws a typed
  `InvoiceNumberConflictError` when the recycled invoice's number has been
  reused by a live invoice, so the UI can prompt the user to pick a fresh
  number before retrying restore.

## 0.12.0 — 2026-08-26

### Recycle Bin accounting (feedback_1_to_7.md §9)

- **Bug fix (highest priority in feedback).** A soft-deleted (recycled)
  invoice previously continued to contribute to Trial Balance, P&L, Balance
  Sheet, GST Summary, and party ledgers. `deleteInvoice` now posts a mirror
  journal entry against the invoice's original journal so the net effect on
  every journal-derived report immediately drops to zero.
- `restoreInvoice` posts an un-mirror (mirror-of-mirror) so the original
  effect returns exactly once — repeated delete → restore cycles stay
  balanced with no drift.
- Journals themselves are NEVER mutated or removed; the audit chain and
  event hash chain stay intact. Every mirror is a fresh `ref_type='reversal'`
  entry with `reverses_id` pointing back at what it neutralises.
- `gstSummary` and `computeReceivables` now filter recycled invoices — they
  read the `invoices` table directly (not the journals), so an explicit
  `deleted_at` filter was needed on those two surfaces.
- New optional field `deletion_reversal_journal_id` on Invoice records the
  mirror journal id while the invoice is in the Recycle Bin (null otherwise).
- Dexie schema bumped to **v7**. Upgrade backfills any pre-existing
  soft-deleted invoices by posting a mirror journal per row so on-disk data
  from earlier versions immediately becomes consistent. Same-shape backfill
  runs on snapshot restore via a new `v6 → v7` migration.

## 0.11.0 — 2026-08-26

### Round Off (feedback_1_to_7.md §1)

- Invoices, Purchases, and Sales Returns now persist an explicit
  `round_off_mode` (`auto` | `none` | `manual`) alongside the existing
  `round_off_paise` so the shopkeeper's rounding choice survives edits,
  restores, and reports.
- New `pre_round_total_paise` field on the same three tables records the
  taxable + GST + cess sum before rounding is applied. Together with
  `round_off_paise`, this makes the header self-describing.
- Invoice form: added a compact "Round off" control in the totals block —
  Auto (nearest ₹1, banker's rounding), None, or Manual (± rupees) — plus a
  "Subtotal" row shown when rounding is active so the pre-round total is
  visible at a glance.
- Journal entries continue to post the rounding difference to the existing
  `4900 Round Off` (other income) account, so the trial balance stays
  balanced to the paise regardless of the mode chosen.
- Dexie schema bumped to **v6**. Upgrade backfills existing rows with
  `round_off_mode = 'auto'` and `pre_round_total_paise = total_paise -
  round_off_paise`, preserving the invariant `pre_round + round_off =
  total`.
